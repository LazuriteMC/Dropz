## What is Dropz?
Dropz makes use of [Rayon](https://github.com/LazuriteMC/Rayon), a physics api for minecraft, in order to
make item drops physics-based. That means that any item thrown onto the ground will now simply come to rest
as a physic object instead of behaving like a vanilla item.

## Features
* Items dropped on the ground behave more realistically.
* Items can be thrown, or "yeeted", by sneaking while dropping the item.
