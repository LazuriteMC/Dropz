## What is Dropz?
Dropz makes use of [Rayon](https://github.com/LazuriteMC/Rayon), a physics api for minecraft, in order to
make item drops physics-based. That means that any item thrown onto the ground will now simply come to rest
as a physic object instead of behaving like a vanilla item.

## Features
* Item drops are now physics based
* Items can be "yeeted" by sneaking while dropping an item
* Items traveling at a fast enough velocity will damage mobs and other players
* No risk to your items saved on the ground if you choose to disable this mod

## Warning
Due to the CPU intensive nature of running a physics engine alongside Minecraft, you may experience decreased
game performance based on how many items there are on the ground around you. For instance, if you throw
hundreds of items onto the ground, you will almost certainly experience a decrease in performance. If you find
yourself in a situation where your world is unplayable, you can simply remove the Dropz jar from your mods
folder to disable the mod.
